"""
Testscript to demonstrate functionality of pyGCluster

A synthetic dataset is used to check the correct installation of pyGCluster.
This dataset contains 10 ratios (Gene 0-9) which were randomly sampled between 
39.5 and 40.5 in 0.1 steps with a low standard deviation (randomly sampled 
between 0.1 and 1) and 90 ratios (Gene 10-99) which were randomly sampled 
between 3 and 7 in 0.1 steps with a high standard deviation (randomly sampled 
between 0.1 and 5)

5000 iterations are performed and the presence of the most frequent cluster is
checked.

This cluster should contain the Genes 0 to 9.

Usage::

    ./test_pyGCluster.py


When the iteration has finished (this should normally take not longer than 20
seconds), the script asks if you want to stop the iteration process or continue::

    iter_max reached. See convergence plot. Stopping re-sampling if not defined 
    otherwise ...
    ... plot of convergence finished. 
    See plot in "../exampleFiles/functionalityCheck/convergence_plot.pdf".

    Enter how many iterations you would like to continue. 
    (Has to be a multiple of iterstep = 5000)
    (enter "0" to stop resampling.)
    (enter "-1" to resample until iter_max (= 5000) is reached.)
    Enter a number ...

Please enter 0 and hit enter (The script will stop and the test will finish).

The results are saved into the folder functionalityCheck.

Additionally expression maps and expression profiles are plotted.
